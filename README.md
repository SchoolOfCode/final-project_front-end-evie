# EVie 

As our final 4 week project team at the School of Code, we decided to build an app for electric vehicle (EV) drivers. 

The name of the app is called **EVie**.


# What problem does this app solve?
The number of EV drivers are increasing and with that comes opportunity to build an app that addresses problems that EV drivers may encounter. A survey we conducted on EV drivers revealed that they wanted an app that:-
1. helps to plan a route from a start point to a destination which shows chargepoints within a certain distance or area of the route.
2. has community participation where users can contribute to information about chargepoints.
3. the app was easy to use with a nice looking interface.
