# EVie

As our final project team at the School of Code, we decided to build an app for electric vehicle (EV) drivers. 

The name of the app is called **EVie**.



# What problem does this app solve?
The number of EV drivers are increasing and with that comes opportunity to build an app that addresses problems that EV drivers may encounter. We conducted a survey on EV drivers asking them what apps they currently use for their journeys and what improvements they would like to see on these apps.

Ev drivers wanted an app that inludes:-
1. help to plan a route from a start point to a destination which shows chargepoints within a certain distance or area of the route.
2. community participation where users contributed information about chargepoints.
3. An easy to use app with a nice looking interface.
